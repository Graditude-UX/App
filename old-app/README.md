# Gratitude Together

This is the start of a prototype for a social media application aimed at connecting college-aged people through gratitude. 

## Description

This app consists of three parts:

  ●  A visual and interactive application that allows users to interact with the globe so that they can view gratitude across the globe. Users will also be able to post short gratitude entries in their own region.


  ● A social media feature where users can add friends and interact more in-depth with their friends posts by liking it or sending a message response. Users will also be able to chat with their friends and when they view their friend’s posts on the globe their friend’s image will appear.


  ● A self and gratitude awareness portion. This feature will include a wristband that tracks happiness trends throughout the day and creates a chart where users can view these trends. Our app will also allow the user to create private gratitude entries and they will have the option to use one of our gratitude prompts or journals without a prompt.
